# (Unofficial) Subsistence hub

### Hello and Welcome!

In hopes of facilitating rapid and organized, constructive input for the game we all play and love, I've set up this github.

This can be a place to capture bug reports and document feature suggestions. Here, they can be discussed and ultimately evolve into a mature, implementable bug fix or feature ticket.
